## 🛡️ What is Networking?

**Room:** [What is Networking? — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/whatisnetworking)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(15 April 2025)* 

### 🎯 Objective
To understand what networks are, how devices communicate with each other, and how this all relates to the wider Internet. This room sets the foundation for networking in cyber security.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts
- Networking Basics – Understanding what a network is and how devices connect.
- Private vs Public IP Addresses – Knowing the difference between local and internet-facing addresses.
- MAC Addresses – Unique hardware identifiers used to identify devices on a network.
- IP Addressing & Subnetting – How IPs are structured and managed within a network.
- Ping & ICMP – Tools and protocols used to test and measure connectivity.
- IPv4 vs IPv6 – Comparing address formats and why IPv6 is important.
- Device Identification – How devices recognise and talk to each other on a network.
- Network Communication Rules – Protocols that ensure devices "speak the same language".

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Ping — used to test connections between devices using ICMP
- TryHackMe Virtual Machine and built-in terminal

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Understanding how devices can have both private and public IP addresses was initially confusing.
- The visual examples and analogies (like Alice and friends) helped make things click.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Devices in a network need IP and MAC addresses to communicate and be recognised.
- The Internet is just a massive collection of smaller connected networks.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Knowing how networks function is essential in cyber security, whether you're defending systems, investigating incidents, or scanning for vulnerabilities. Understanding IPs, MACs, and how devices are identified helps avoid security assumptions that attackers can exploit.

---

### 💭 Reflections:
- I found the breakdown of private vs public IPs and how they work with ISPs really interesting.
- I wouldn’t approach anything differently this time, but I’ll definitely build on this knowledge as things get more technical.
- The realisation that networks are everywhere — even in something like smart traffic lights — was eye-opening.
